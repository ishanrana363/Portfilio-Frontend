MongoDB’s NoSQL database enables scalable storage of product details, user information, and order histories in a flexible, JSON-like format. Express.js, as a backend framework, manages server-side logic, APIs, and routing for order processing and user authentication. React powers dynamic, responsive frontends, creating an engaging shopping experience with fast page loads and smooth user interactions. Node.js supports scalable, real-time data handling, crucial for managing simultaneous user requests in high-traffic e-commerce sites.
