MongoDB serves as the database, storing data in a flexible, JSON-like format, ideal for working with JavaScript. Express.js is a minimalist web framework for Node.js, simplifying the creation of server-side logic. React, a popular frontend library, allows developers to create dynamic, interactive UIs with reusable components. Node.js, a runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server, completes the stack, enabling seamless communication between frontend and backend. Together, the MERN stack supports full-stack JavaScript development.</h1>
